This repository stores Jupyter Notebooks with interesting examples of the use of machine learning algorithms.
- 01 reduccion de dimensionalidad: Analizes two approaches for dimensionality reduction. With a ranking of variables based on Co-relation you can select some variables. Using PCA you can compress the dataset into the quantity of variables that you need.
- 02 Clustering-Iris: Implements kmeans for the clustering of Iris species. And checks the clustering with tagged data.
- 03 Regressions-Tesla: Different regresion algorithms was compared in order to predict Tesla's stock price. Includes: simple and multiple linear regresions and plynomial regressions.
- 04 clasificadores binarios: A couple of binary classifiers was implemented in order to show basically class predictions but also, to show the confusion matrix.
